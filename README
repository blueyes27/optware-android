NSLU2-Linux Optware for Android
===============================

This project provides a generic bootstrap script to install
NSLU2-Linux Optware (http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/Optware/HomePage)
on any Android device which has root access.

Unlike other optware-for-android projects you may find on the Internet,
this project:

* Intended to be a generic install script suitable for any device.
  It may be not there just yet, but that's the aim.

* Doesn't ship binary blobs of unknown origin. Any binaries it
  installs on your device, it first downloads from well-known sources
  like NSLU2 Optware repository itself or CodeSourcery toolchain
  archives (for libc on which Optware for ARM depends).
